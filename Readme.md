# WEB103 Project 2 - SoundScout ðŸŽ¶

Submitted by: **Venkatesh Kelam**

About this web app: **SoundScout helps users discover local live music events. It connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch event details such as name, artists, date/time, venue, genre, and ticket price. The app allows users to browse through events, view details on each event, and filter by category or search by attributes.**

Time spent: **5** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured database table for the list items**
  - [x] **Walkthrough includes a screenshot of the Render dashboard showing that the Postgres database is available**
  - [x] **Walkthrough includes a demonstration of the table contents using `psql` and `SELECT * FROM events;`**

  ## Database Verification

- [x] Detail view for each event with styled image, description, and metadata
- [x] Dark theme styling with Pico.css and custom CSS
- [x] 404 page with SVG and a link back to home

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered:
- Getting PostgreSQL connected correctly on Render (SSL issues required `PGSSLMODE=require` in `.env`).
- Ensuring CSS grid always displayed exactly 3 cards per row on desktop without breaking mobile responsiveness.
- Fixing the hero background issue: Express was serving `404.svg` for missing images, so I had to adjust both the CSS and the Express 404 middleware.
- Debugging template placeholders so that detail pages correctly displayed event images and metadata.
